Compilation overview
---

- Two steps of compilation:
    - *compiling*: text `.c` file to  relocatable `.o` (object) file
    - *linking*: multiple relocatable `.o` files to one executable `.o` file
        - *symbol*: reference to link construct (declaration) in one `.o` file to construct (definition) in another `.o` file

C: basics
---

```c
#include <stdio.h> //preprocessor
int y = 3; //global var. (def. & init.)
//extern int y; //global var. (dec.)
int main() //function (def.)
{
    int x = 0; //local var. (def. & init.), literal, 
    printf("y = %d\n",y); //function (invocation)
    return 0;
}
```

Life of a C construct
---

| | variable | function 
| --- | --- | --- |
| declare | `extern int x;` | `void foo();`
| define | `int x;` | `void foo(){}`
| initialize | `int x = 6;`
| reference | `y = x;x=1;` | `foo();` (invocation)
| destroy | | 

Gcc: Flags
---

- `-c` for compile, `-o` for output; demo
- `-Wall`, w for warning; demo 
- `-I` for `#include`; demo
    - header file (storing declarations)
- `-Ldir`/`-lmylib` for library to link
    - search library for unsolved symbols (functions, global variables) when linking
- `-g` for debug (later)

Compiler process

| compilation step | | main flag | secondary flags |
| --- | --- | ---  | --- |
| preprocessor | `.c`->`.i` | | `-I./includes` (rpath) 
| compiling | `.i`->`.o` | `gcc -c` |
| assembler | `.s`->`.o`(relocatable) | `gcc -s` |
| linker | `.o`(relocatable),`.a`->`.o`(executable) | (no flag) | `-L. -lx`, `-Wl,` |
 
* `-Wl,option` Pass `option` to the linker. For example, `-Wl,-Map,output.map` passes `-Map output.map` to the linker.
- `-L`
    - gcc flag `-L/home/lib` is equal to environment var `export LIBRARY_PATH=/home/lib`
- `gcc A B`: it compiles B first then A.

make
---

```
all: link
\t./a.out

linklib: compilelib
\tgcc h1.o -L. -lx #-L. is necessary

compilelib: compile
\tmv h2.o libx.a
\tar cr liby.a h2.o h1.o

link: compile 
\tgcc h1.o h2.o

compile:
\tgcc -c h1.c
\tgcc -c h2.c

clean:
\trm *.o *.out
```

```
SRCS = h1.c h2.c
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

all: link
\t./a.out

link: $(OBJS)
\t$(CC) $(OBJS)
```

Makefile: Variables
---

- variable represents strings of text
- standard variable: `CC`, `CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`
    - `LDFLAGS` library search path (`-L`)
    - `OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)`: 
        - This incantation says that the object files  have the same name as the .c files, but with .o

Makefile: Dependency rules
---

- dependency rules: tells how to make a target based on changes to a list of certain files.
- If-this-then-that
    - dependency line: a trigger that says when to do something
    - command line: specifies what to do

Homework 4 - 2
---

1. In your Ubuntu, open course website (https://github.com/syracuse-fullstacksecurity/cis342) (e.g. using Firefox) and hit the green "Clone or download" button to download all the files into a .zip file. Extract the zip file and cd into "marw4" directory. Type command "make"  to build and execute binary "a.out". Type command "ls" to list all files. Then type command "make clean" and command "ls" to show object files (with extension ".o") are gone. Submit a screenshot of your terminal.

2. We use the following command to compile `h2.c` as a library: `gcc -c h2.c -o liby.a`. Edit the file named "makefile" and add a new rule about the command. You may use `compilelib` as its label. And then type "make compilelib" to compile `h2.c` as a library. Submit the screenshot.

3. We can compile `h1.c` and link it to the library we just created using command `gcc -o a.out h1.c -L. -ly`. Add this command to the makefile with a new rule named `liblink`. What argument do you provide to "make" so that it can link the library liby. Provide a screenshot of making the program.

Pointer in C (Apr. W1)
===

References
---

- Pointer Basics: [[http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/106/](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/106/)]

Pointer (C syntax)
---

- a pointer is a variable that stores a reference to something. 
     - "something", called pointee, is usually another variable.
- e.g.: a pointer variable named `x` referencing to a "pointee" variable of value `42`. 

![pointer pointee](./images/PointerPointee.gif)

<!--

![pointer pointee](/Users/tristartom/workspace/teaching/cis342/cis342/images/PointerPointee.gif)

-->

Pointer operations
---

- definition/initialization: `int *p1 = p2;` 
- dereference: `*p`
- get reference of: `& a` 
    - get the *address* (memory location) of variable `a` 

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int a = 10;
    int * p = & a;
    int b = *p;
    printf("a=%d,b=%d,*p=%d,p=%p\n",a,b,*p,p);
}
```

Life of a `C` pointer/symbol
---

| | pointer | variable | function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| declare | `extern int * p` |`extern int x` | `void foo()` | 
| define | `int *p;` | `int x` | `void foo(){}` | 
| initialize | `int *p=&a;` | `int x=6` | |
| | `int*q=malloc(7)` | |
| reference | `*p=x;x=*p` | `y=x` | `foo()` |
| destroy | `delete p` | | |

<!--

`int *p` (behavior undefined!) 

-->

Exercise
---

- Do the following to complete the code snippet at the bottom. Then compile and execute your program. Submit the completed program to BB.
    1. define two pointers `p1` and `p2`, both pointing to variable `x`. 
    2. Use `p1` to update `x`'s value to `5`.
    3. Then use `p2` to read the value of variable `x` and `printf` it on terminal.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int x = 4;
    // To complete the program below:


}
```

Virtual memory in C (Apr. W1)
===

Introduction
---

- we talked about pointers
- but **where does a pointer point to?**
- this is related to the *virtual memory* model in C/C++.
- References
    - "Using GNU's GDB Debugger: Memory Layout And The Stack", by Peter Jay Salzman [[link](http://www.dirac.org/linux/gdb/02a-Memory_Layout_And_The_Stack.php)]


Four variable "types" in C
---

1. *global* variable: defined outside a function
2. *local* variable: defined inside a function
3. *dynamically-allocated* variable: allocated by `malloc()`
    - `int * p = malloc(2*sizeof(int));`
4. *static (local)* variable: defined inside a function, with keyword `static`
    - `static int x;`, [[example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_variable#Scope)]

---

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
// global variable x
int x = 1;
void foo(){
  static int t = 5;
  printf("t in foo = %d\n", t);
}

int main(){
  // local variable y
  int y = 2;
  // dynamically-allocated variable pz
  int * pz = malloc(2*sizeof(int));
  // static local variable t
  static int t = 4;
  foo();
  printf("t in main = %d\n", t);
  printf("x at %p\ny at %p\npz to %p\nt at %p\n", &x, &y, pz, &t);
  return 0;
}
```

Variable type: scope and visibility
---

| variable type | scope | visibility | memory location |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| global variable | global | global | `.rodata`/`.bss` |
| static variable | global | nested local | `.rodata`/`.bss` |
| local variable | local | nested local | `stack` |
| dynamically-allocated var | dynamic | global | `heap` |

- static local variable
    - Possible to define multiple static local variables of the same name, defined in different functions. 
    - They represent different memory locations. 
- The case of the preceding code.

Virtual memory layout
---

1. Segments `.text,.bss,.rodata` 
    - From executable `a.out`
2. Segments `stack`, `heap`
    - Runtime info.: values of symbols during execution
- Each segment (or page) has its own permission. 


Virtual memory layout
---

```
 VirAddr Space               
+------------+--+     
|  kernel    |  |        a.out

Executable file format (ELF)
---

- The file format of `a.out`
- Sections
    - code `.text` 
    - constant value `.rodata`
    - demo: `size a.out` (sections)
- Symbol table
    - demo: `nm -m a.out` (symbol table)

Symbol table
---

- basic symbol table `gcc x.c`
    - name list: addresses of symbol names and machine code
- enhanced symbol table `gcc -g x.c`: 
    - for each symbol (variable and function address), name
    - for each machine codeline, its source codeline
    - source file name 

```

Examining Stack 
---

- stack: frames, local variables, arguments, return
    - `backtrace`/`bt`/`bt full`,`where`
    - `up`,`down`,`frame #`
        - **context**

<!--

Exercise
---

- Use gdb to debug the following program. Set a breakpoint at `fact` function and examine the stack using `backtrace` during the execution of the program. Find and describe the bug in BB.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int fact(int x){
  return x*fact(x-1);
}
int main(){
  printf("%d\n",fact(5));
}
```

-->

Exercise 1
---

- Use gdb to debug the following program. Identify the bug line.

```c
int main() {
     void * p = "x";
     *p = 'y';}
```

Exercise 2
---

- Use gdb to debug the following program. Identify the bug line.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    double x[10000000]; //vs x[1000];?
    x[13]=1; printf("%f\n",x[13]);}
```

<!--

- Segmentation fault
    - buffer overflow: stack/heap...
    - memory protection
    - null pointer dereference

Pointer Homework

- Compile and execute the following program. Describe the difference between a pointer and an array. What is the difference if we use an array instead of a pointer in the following program?
#include <stdio.h>
void main(){
        int *a;
        int i;
        for (i=0; i<10; i++)
                a[i]=i;
        for (i=0; i<10; i++){
                printf("%d",*a);
                (*a)++;
        }
}
- In the previous question, what will happen if we assign 10000 values instead of 10 values to the pointer? Why?
- Write code to declare a variable named "foo". Now declare a pointer named "bar". What do you do to make foo changed every time we change bar?
- We can find out the size of a variable using sizeof(varname) and print it using printf("%d",sizeof(varname)). Print the size of variables "a", "i", "a[0]", and "a[1]" in the program in first question. Describe your observation.
- The _________ , also known as the address operator, returns the memory address of a variable. a.asterisk (*) b. ampersand (&) c. percent sign (%) d. exclamation point (!)
- With pointer variables, you can __________ manipulate data stored in other variables. a. never b. seldom c. indirectly d. All of these
- A pointer may be initialized with a. the address of an existing object b. the value of an integer variable c. the value of a floating point variable d. all of these

Data type
---

- C language is typed, but assembly/machine instructions are not
- C data type determines:
    - how much space to allocate to store variable in memory
    - how to interpret the bit-string stored in the memory
    - how to calculate "primitive" arithmetic on the variable

---

- signed, unsigned, long long, float, char
    - unsigned: 
        - a 32-bit unsigned integer, value from 0 to $2^{32}-1$.
    - signed: 
        - a 32-bit unsigned integer, value from $-2^{31}$ to $2^{32}-1$.
        - negative numbers are represented by two's complement, (which is suited for binary adders).

| type | signed | unsigned | short | long long | float | char |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sizeof()` | 4 | 4 | 2 | 8 | 4 | 1 |



Typecasting
---

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
  int i = 5;
  float f = (float) i;
  float d = f/3; // float d2 = i/3;
  printf("%f\n",d);
}
```

Pointer types
---

- Array 
    - A `C` array is a list of `n` elements of a specific data type, and allocated in `n` adjacent memory locations.
    - A null byte in the end is a delimiter character 
- Array and pointer
    - `int a[];` vs `int *b = a;`

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int a[] = {2,1,0};
    int *b = a;
    unsigned long c = (unsigned long)a;//long

- Code-pointer: function pointer
- Data-pointer: pointer to variable, array
    - Pointer data type: `char *`, `int *`, 
    - Pointer arithmetic: equiv. code
        - `int * p = array; p += 1;`
        - `int pp = array; pp += sizeof(int);`

Function execution and stack (Apr.w3)
===

Stack
---

- Stack:
    - store **context** information
    - a stack of frames, with the top frame pushed (popped) by entering (leaving) a function
- Stack pointer: `RSP`, pointing to the stack end
- Frame pointer: `RBP`, pointing to the start of top frame.

Entering function in Assembly
---

- Calling convention, function prologue and `call` instruction.
- `SFP` is for restoring `RBP` to previous value, and the return address is used to restore `RIP` 

---

- in `gdb`, `b test`, `x/16xw $RSP`

<!--Stack_example.c-->
```c
void test(int a, int b, int c, int d) { 
  int flag;
  char buffer[10];
  flag = 31337;
  buffer[0] = 'A'; 
}
int main() {
  test(1, 2, 3, 4);
}
```

Commandline argument
---

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { 
  if(argc < 2) return 1;
  printf("arg is %s\n", argv[1]); //%s for char array
}
```

```bash
./a.out helloworld
```

Exercise
---

- Debug the following program using `gdb`:
    - in Ubuntu, compile the program by `gcc -g auth.c -fno-stack-protector`
    - `strcpy`/`strcmp` copies/compares the two string arguments
    - find a commandline argument that is not password but passes the authentication.
    - find the bug and describe what the bug is in BB.
    - `gdb --args a.out ARGS` launches `a.out` with `ARGS`.

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <string.h>
int check_authentication(char *password) { 
  int auth_flag = 0;
  char password_buffer[16];
  strcpy(password_buffer, password);
  if(strcmp(password_buffer,"12345")==0)auth_flag=1;
  if(strcmp(password_buffer,"54321")==0)auth_flag=1;
  return auth_flag; 
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { 
  if(argc < 2) exit(0); 
  if(check_authentication(argv[1])) { 
    printf("\nAccess Granted.\n"); 
  } else {
    printf("\nAccess Denied.\n");
  } 
}
```

Program structure
---

- Demo:
    - 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf( "Hello World!\n" );
    return 0;
}
```

    - Compiling using GCC: ``gcc hello.c``
    - Using variables: ``int a;``
    - Printing an integer variable: ``printf("%d",a);``
    - Getting integer input from user: ``scanf("%d",&a);`` 
    - Assigning value to a variable: ``a=2017;``

- Exercise:
    - Write a program to get 2 integers from the user and print the sum of them
    - Try printing integers and text together: ``int a; a=2017; printf("March %d",a);``
    - Try ``a++;``, ``a*=5;``
    - Write a program to swap the value of two integer variables
    
Functions
---

- Demo:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int power ( int x, int y );

int main()
{
    printf("%d",power(2,11));
}

int power (int x, int y)
{
  int i,out=1;
  for (i=0; i&lt;y; i++)
    out*=x;
  return out;
}
```
- Exercise:
    - Write a function that gets n as the input and calculates nth number in Fibonacci sequence.
    - Write a function that gets n as the input and returns 1 if it is a prime number and returns 0 if it is not.

Arrays
---

- Demo:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int i,fib[10];
	fib[0]=1;
	fib[1]=1;
	for (i=2; i<10; i++)
		fib[i]=fib[i-1]+fib[i-2];
	for (i=0; i<10; i++)		
		printf("%d\n",fib[i]);
}
```

- The C++ Language Tutorial [[link](http://www.cplusplus.com/files/tutorial.pdf)], Chapter "Object oriented programming, Classes (I)"

Compound data type: struct
---

- `struct` is compound data type 
- `struct` is custom data type
    - define your own `struct`

```c
#include<stdio.h>

struct movies_t {
  char * title;
  int year;
};
int main (){
  struct movies_t amovie;
  struct movies_t * pmovie;
  pmovie = &amovie;
  amovie.title = "the usual suspects";
  pmovie->year = 1995;
  printf("Movie %s is released in year %d\n", pmovie->title, pmovie->year);
  return 0; 
}
```

class
---

| | compound type | class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| declare | `struct sname {mvar} iname;` | `class cname {mfunc();}` |
| define  | N/A  | `cname::mfunc(){}` |



- class is an expanded, compound data type, in that:
     1. "class holds both data and function", while compound data type holds data
     2. class defines access policy

```c
 class CRectangle {
    int x, y;
  public:
    void set_values (int,int);
    int area (void);
} rect;
```

Object
---

- An object is an instance of class.

| life span | var | object |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| declare | `extern int x;` |  `class cname {} objname;` | |
| define (pointer) | `int x;` | `cname * objname` |
| initialize | `int x=5;` | `cname * objname = new cname();` |
| reference | `x=3;` | `objname->foo();` |
| destroy | | `delete objname;` |


---

- Private members of a class are referenced only from within other members of the same class.
    - reference is between a pointer and pointee.
    - access policy (`public` or `private`) is about the permission of referencing pointee given the context of the pointer.

<!--

Essence of an "object" (Revisit)
---

- "A **class** is an expanded concept of a data **structure**: instead of holding only data, it can hold both data and functions."
- "An **object** is an instantiation of a class. In terms of variables, a class would be the type, and an object would be the variable."

-->

Demo
---

```cpp
// classes example
#include <stdio.h>
class CRectangle {
    int x, y;
  public:
    void set_values (int,int);
    int area () {return (x*y);}
};
void CRectangle::set_values (int a, int b) { x = a;
y = b; }
int main () {
  CRectangle rect;
  rect.set_values (3,4);
  printf("area: %d\n", rect.area());
  return 0;
}

}
```

Homebrew `printf`
---

```c
void print() {
  char * message = "hello world";
  asm ( "mov $12, %%rdx\n\t"
      "mov %0, %%rcx\n\t"
      "mov $0, %%rbx\n\t"
      "mov $4, %%rax\n\t"
      "int $0x80 \n\t"
      ::"r"(message):"rdx","rcx","rbx");
}
int main(){
   print("hello world\n");
}
```

System call
---

- `int` represents interrupt to CPU
- Syscall is one kind of interrupt
    - syscall interrupts CPU's normal execution and forces it to jump to a kernel routine and run it under kernel mode.
    - CPU will save the context information to the kernel-space memory.
